      This specification defines a set of classes and properties that
      structure information about military history.

    <h3 id="status">Status of this Document</h3>
    <p>
      This document grows iteratively over time, with modification made over
      time. Continuity is ensured using the <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Annotations">OWL ontology
      annotations</a> for ontological compatibility and for deprecated classes and properties.
      Ontology terms remain present whether deprecated or not.
    </p>
    <p><i>This ontology is going through large documentation changes. Terms should be considered to be stable.</i></p>.

    <h3 id="organi">Military Trades, Appointments and Ranks</h3>

    <p>The human resources of military organizations are complex, redundant and sometimes follow traditions that are long running. 
    To this end the ontology makes use of three different classes:
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#MilitaryRank">Military Rank</a>,
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#MilitaryAppointment">Military Appointments</a> and 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#MilitaryTrade">Military Trades</a>. All ontology terms regarding
    personnel posts are instances of these three classes. This complexity is necessary to deal with the entailment of a person being in a single post within a military organization
    where the relationship between a person's title, tasks performed, authority and rate of pay are more than merely complex.</p>
    <p>The terms were created from extracts of military databases, Wikipedia and book extracts. Whenever possible, a term has a
    generic instances that is sub-classed for specific military contexts.</p> 
    
    <h3 id="armedServices">Armed Services</h3>

    <p>The following services have concepts within the ontology: 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#NavyServiceBranch">Navy</a>, 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#ArmyServiceBranch">Army</a> and 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#AirForceServiceBranch">Air Force</a>. A 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#ProtoAirForce">special term</a> exists for
    air force units that are attached to Navy or Army units.
    </p>

    <h3 id="arms">Arms</h3>

    <p>The following arms have concepts within the ontology: 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#Armor">Armor</a>, 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#Artillery">Artillery</a>, 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#Cavalry">Cavalry</a> and
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#Infantry">Infantry</a>. The  
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#NavyServiceBranch">Navy Service Branch</a> and 
    <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#ProtoAirForce">ProtoAirForce</a>/<a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military#AirForceServiceBranch">Air Force Service Branch</a> are also
    instances of arms.   
    </p>

    <h3 id="arms">Notes on naming, labelling in multicultural environments</h3>

    <p>One of the issues in semantic web databases is that <i>difference between the thing and the name of thing</i>, which
    throws off most beginners first using the semantic web.In most cases, a modern label exists in most languages that can be
    used to identify the thing for human consumption.  In other cases, the label
    itself entails more information that can be can be conveyed through a simple
    property such as rdfs:label or muninn:acronym.  In these situations, the
    terms is typed as an skos-xl label instance that labels both the underlying
    instance of the thing and links to the contextual use of that label, such as
    slang, historical period.</p>

     <h4 id="example_NamedRegiment">A named regiment: The Blue Puttees</h2>
    
    <p>The <a
    href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ww1/2011/11/11/Regiment/newfoundland">Newfoundland Regiment</a> was initially raised after the onset
    of the British declaration of war on Germany as the Dominion of
    Newfoundland's contribution to the war effort. After the battle of the
    Ypres, the <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ww1/2011/11/11/Regiment/rnewfoundland">Royal Newfoundland
    Regiment<a/> was recognized for its achievements by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_V">King George V</a> with the Royal prefix to its name.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1914, the Battalion-Sized regiment numbered 500 initially
    and was nicknamed the 'Blue Puttees' for the color of their <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puttee">Puttee</a>
    that were dark blue instead of khaki. By the end of the Great War, over 2,200 Newfoundlanders served in the Regiment. The  <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ww1/2011/11/11/Regiment/rnewfoundland">Royal Newfoundland
    Regiment<a/> is commemorated by both a residential street "Blue Puttee Drive"
    in St. John's, Newfoundland (2005) and one of the ferry that links
    Newfoundland to the mainland, the MV Blue Puttes.</p>

    <h4 id="example_RegimentalRoll">Recording regimental rolls</h2>   
    
     <p>A Regimental Roll, a document recording the soldiers part of a Regiment at a point in time is a commonly seen historical
     document. However, they are problematic in that they represent the roster of the Regiment at a single point in time whereas
     soldiers are continually joining and leaving the unit over time. This is also true of some biographical information that
     will be listed in some commemoration plaques that list a rank along with the person's details.
     </p>
    <div class="example" style="white-space: pre-wrap;" id="basic">
    <pre> 
    &lt;mil:Soldier rdf:about="<a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/bna/2011/11/11/Soldier/7b9c018d7774454517039fb700d1d145"> Pvt. Joseph Preston </a>"&gt;

     &lt;mil:deathday rdf:resource="<a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/bna/2011/11/11/Death/7b9c018d7774454517039fb700d1d145"> Joseph's Death</a>"/&gt;
     &lt;-- These properties are inherited from the foaf ontologies --&gt;
     &lt;mil:name&gt;Joseph Preston&lt;/mil:name&gt;
     &lt;mil:firstName&gt;Joseph&lt;/mil:firstName&gt;

    &lt;/mil:Soldier&gt;     
    </pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>One could generate an empty event that would account for Private Preston's enlistment and promotion to Private, however in
    some cases the complexity in descriptive RDF is not warranted or wanted. The heldRank property is for these occasions and
    special case should be made to ensure that the data has provenance information so that a gross temporal period can be
    assigned to the event.</p>

    <h2 id="notesEvent">Notes on Military Events</h2>
     <p>There are over a half-dozen vocabularies that deal with events, each with different semantics. At present none are
     dominant or able to deal in a structured way with all of the facets of recording a real world event. To record events, the
     military ontology provides a term MilitaryEvent that is really an empty class that is ontologically linked to every known
     class resembling an event. While not intended as a long term solution, it provides SKOS/OWL translation to as many
     alternate vocabularies and ontologies without claiming to be a superior solution. Temporal anchoring is provided by Time
     OWL, participants are recorded by being linked to the event through a Role with the notable exception of the hasPrincipal
     properties that links the principal actors to their event.</p>

    <h2 id="notesSKOS">Notes on SKOS and OWL</h2>
    <p>SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) enjoys widespread popularity in the semantic
    web community as it provides simple terms for taxonomies without requiring reasoner support.
    Whenever appropriate, SKOS terms are inserted within the military ontology to link terms to
    each other. However, since these terms are not ontologically powered their scalability is
    limited since each additional layer of terms within a taxonomy requires another database
    query.</p>
    <p>Some of the constructs within the military ontology are deep and require reasoning support.
    OWL is the preferred means of using this ontology, through the usage of the terms, SKOS-style,
    is possible. </p> 
    
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion and Future Work</h2>

    <p>Modelling military organizations is a complex endeavour that is made all that more so because of historical changes made to
    them over time. This ontology is a first step in standardizing references to military units, ranks and events.</p>
